# About Springblog

## Overview

This project allows users to create accounts, and post blogs. The website uses Thymeleaf security to verify users are logged into the creatorâ€™s account so they cannot edit or remove any blogs that do not belong to them. The project also sends the users an email to their specified email, letting them know a new post was created, using MailTrap API.
